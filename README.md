# D-D-D
Dungeons &amp; Dwarves &amp; Deception

A networked, PS4 competitive dungeon crawler/builder. How far can you crawl?

D&amp;D&amp;D is a topdown competitive dungeon crawler built for the PS4. It supports single player and both 2-player local and 4-player LAN and matchmade networked multiplayer. 

In singleplayer, see how far you can get in a pseudo-randomly generated string of dungeon rooms while evading traps. The longer you go, the higher your score!

In multiplayer, race against your friends to reach the final room of the dungeon, or hinder your friends by knocking them into traps and off ledges. The final room will either be a king-of-the-hill gold mound or a final boss. If you die, you get no points, so you might want to rethink dooming them in case you're left all alone agains the Slime King.

D&amp;D&amp;D also features 4 playable characters, an additional unlockable character, and a multitude of play-based and skill-based achievements. You might unlock most just by having fun with friends, but the coveted gold dwarf is reserved for only the quickest and hardiest dwarves.

For this repo, the standalone build is in the Build folder, compiled for standalone Windows target. If that doesn't work and you have Unity installed, you can simply open it as a fresh project and rebuild for your platform. Only standalone Windows target and PS4 were tested for this project, so it might not build for additional platforms.
