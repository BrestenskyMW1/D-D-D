# D-D-D
Dungeons &amp; Dwarves &amp; Deception

A networked, PS4 competitive dungeon crawler/builder. How far can you crawl?

D&amp;D&amp;D is a topdown competitive dungeon crawler built for the PS4. It supports single player and both 2-player local and 4-player LAN and matchmade networked multiplayer. 

In singleplayer, see how far you can get in a pseudo-randomly generated string of dungeon rooms while evading traps. The longer you go, the higher your score!

In multiplayer, race against your friends to reach the final room of the dungeon, or hinder your friends by knocking them into traps and off ledges. The final room will either be a king-of-the-hill gold mound or a final boss. If you die, you get no points, so you might want to rethink dooming them in case you're left all alone agains the Slime King.

D&amp;D&amp;D also features 4 playable characters, an additional unlockable character, and a multitude of play-based and skill-based achievements. You might unlock most just by having fun with friends, but the coveted gold dwarf is reserved for only the quickest and hardiest dwarves.

This version of the game is written for PC/Mac/Linux standalone support through Unity, though it is created with controller support in mind. We cannot guarantee compilation for a PS4 if you have a PS4 dev kit and license because the game was developed without PS4 support and the PS4 SDK.
